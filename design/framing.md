# Narrative use of restaurants

The restaurant as:

* a backdrop for dinner table conversation
* a destination / place of meeting / plan.
* a catalyst, setting the story in motion - i.e. a fire, take-over, murder.
* a property, explored through its exploitation and ownership 
* a place of work, told from the perspective of a staff member
* a front for a covert operation
* a gateway between worlds.
* an extended metaphor.
* a punchline / secret code / double entendre.
* a glue, binding generations of people across time.
* a point of reference for a street / neighbourhood.
* a living organism.
* a line item on a corporate balance sheet.
* a market place.
* a exclusive venue attracting - and accepting - only those with rarified tastes - and deep pockets.
* the only game in town - a necessity.
* a physical space where the markings and decor are traces of historic events. 
* the extension of one's personality / philsoophy / life goals.
* punishment - self-imposed or otherwise.
* therapy. Telling your server all about your life and find someone who actually listens to you, nods at all the right times and can hardly disagree with whatever you're saying -  they'll never know the other side of the story... (**Clelia**)
* a place of accelerated intimacy. A place to bring mistresses and escorts where the restaurant is just the stage of foreplay, pretending that there's more of a personal relationship than there actually is/or the place where you take your mistress and make them feel like you're taking them out in public and spending proper time with them although you probably aren't - restaurant staff is keeper of many secrets. (**Clelia**)
* a place for business. With private rooms, wine flowing, and way too many cigars and god knows what deals are struck. (**Clelia**)
